We are currently running a research project on the interactions between the ionizable DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) lipid and POPE, POPC, DOPE, and DOPC bilayers. In this project, we are trying to identify and explain the reason behind the different predictions by the SLipids and CHARMM36 force fields on the aggregation and accumulation behavior of the MC3 lipids in these bilayers. 

In this repository you can find raw data for the density profiles along the membrane normal, force field files, and SLipids-CHARMM36 naming conversion scripts, as well as the compilation of the preliminary results (mc3_results.pdf). Our trajectories are available on Zenodo (we will update this part as the data becomes available).

Please note that, none of this work is peer-reviewed nor published. Therefore, use the data at your own risk. If you have any questions, comments, or want to contribute, please open a pull request. We would be proud to correct our mistakes, happy to have you on board, pleased to see our data serves use for someone. 

No reasonable/unreasonable requests nor contacts are needed for anyone to use this data set. Please feel free to use and share your results.
